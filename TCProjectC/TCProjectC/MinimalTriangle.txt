PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a int length.
We have a regular hexagon: a polygon with six sides, in which all internal angles have 120 degrees and length is the length of each side.
We are going to draw three non-intersecting diagonals in some way.
These will divide the hexagon into four triangles.
We will then compute their areas, take a piece of paper and write down the smallest of those four areas.
Compute and return the largest number we can obtain on our piece of paper (by choosing which diagonals to draw).
