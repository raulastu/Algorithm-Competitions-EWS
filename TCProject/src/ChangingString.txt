PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given two Strings A and B that have the same length and contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').  The distance between two letters is defined as the absolute value of their difference.  The distance between A and B is defined as the sum of the differences between each letter in A and the letter in B at the same position. For example, the distance between "abcd" and "bcda" is 6 (1 + 1 + 1 + 3).

You must change exactly K characters in A into other lowercase letters.  Return the minimum possible distance between A and B after you perform that change.

DEFINITION
Class:ChangingString
Method:distance
Parameters:String, String, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int distance(String A, String B, int K)


CONSTRAINTS
-A and B will each contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-K will be between 1 and the length of A, inclusive.
-A and B will contain the same number of characters.
-A and B will contain only lowercase letters ('a' - 'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"ab"
"ba"
2

Returns: 0

The minimum distance (equal to 0) can be achieved when we change 'a' to 'b' and 'b' to 'a'.

1)
"aa"
"aa"
2

Returns: 2

We must change both letters 'a' to some other letters. Changing them to 'b' results in the smallest distance.


2)
"aaa"
"baz"
1

Returns: 1



3)
"fdfdfdfdfdsfabasd"
"jhlakfjdklsakdjfk"
8

Returns: 24



4)
"aa"
"bb"
2

Returns: 0
